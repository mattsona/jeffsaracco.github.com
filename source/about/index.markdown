I am a Software Developer living in New York City.

I attended college at the [State University of New York college at Geneseo](http://geneseo.edu/), where I studied Computer Science and Mathematics. While attending I worked as a teachers assistant in the Computer Science dept instructing and grading labs for introductory/survey classes and major classes which dealt with (among other things) the programming languages Java, C, and SPIM assembly language. I was also a research assistant for the computer science dept in conjunction with the BioMath initiative dealing with simulating Small World Networks. The research is published on ACM (available [here](http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1181860))
